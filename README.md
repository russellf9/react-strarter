# react-starter

## Description

A very simple app to help me learn [react](http://facebook.github.io/react)

Largely based on the tutorial from: [Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)


## Running the app

Start up the MAMP server and run from: http://localhost:8888/www.factornine.co.uk/development/react-starter/app/

Also, as we are running via a server the json file loads using AJAX.
